I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to noneAnd I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devilI am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this businessSew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobodyGirl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nationsCausing grief in human relationsIt's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, facesWhere your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a colorDon't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's whiteI'm Gonna Make A Change,
